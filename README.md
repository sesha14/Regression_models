1. Used the housing dataset provided in the link, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing

2. Picked a number of features that have correlation and ploted pairs of them to confirm that they are correlated.

3. Picked few features with numerical values to be predicted by the other features in the dataset. 

4. Separated the data into training, validation, and test sets.

5. Applied various Scikit Learn regression methods to the data.

6. Quantified how good a job each method did in predicting the value of the dependent variable (using your test data set).
